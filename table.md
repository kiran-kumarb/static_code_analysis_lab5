### Step 3: Identify and Document Issues

| Issue Type                            | Tool                     | Line(s)         | Description                                                                                               | Fix Approach                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutable default argument              | Pylint                   | 8               | Function `addItem` used `logs=[]` as a default argument, causing the same list to be shared across calls. | Changed default to `None` and initialized inside function.                          |
| Bare except                           | Pylint / Bandit / Flake8 | 19              | `except:` block catches all exceptions, hiding real errors.                                               | Replaced with specific exception type `except KeyError:` and added logging message. |
| Use of `eval()`                       | Bandit / Pylint          | 59              | `eval()` executes arbitrary code and poses a major security risk.                                         | Removed `eval()` completely.                                                        |
| File handling without context manager | Pylint                   | 26, 32          | Files were opened using `open()` and not closed properly.                                                 | Replaced with `with open(..., encoding='utf-8')` for automatic closing.             |
| Naming convention (camelCase)         | Flake8 / Pylint          | 8–48            | Functions used `camelCase` names (e.g., `addItem`, `removeItem`), violating PEP8.                         | Renamed to `snake_case` (`add_item`, `remove_item`, etc.).                          |
| Missing docstrings                    | Pylint                   | Multiple (8–48) | Functions lacked docstrings explaining purpose and parameters.                                            | Added short descriptive docstrings for every function.                              |
| Unused import                         | Pylint / Flake8          | 2               | `import logging` was unused in the original code.                                                         | Integrated `logging` module properly for logs.                                      |
| No newline at EOF                     | Flake8 / Pylint          | 61              | File did not end with a newline, violating PEP8 formatting.                                               | Added final newline at the end of the file.                                         |
| Logging f-string interpolation        | Pylint                   | 38, 58, 64, 66  | Used f-strings inside logging calls.                                                                      | Switched to lazy formatting using `%s` and `%d` placeholders.                       |
| Inconsistent return statements        | Pylint                   | 33              | Function `add_item()` returned `logs` in one path but nothing in others.                                  | Ensured all branches consistently return `logs`.                                    |
| Global statement warning              | Pylint                   | 89              | Use of `global stock_data` flagged for maintainability.                                                   | Suppressed locally with `# pylint: disable=global-statement`.                       |
